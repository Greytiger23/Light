Greetings from Light! The goal of this project is to give the user recommendations for music based on the music they already enjoy. It seeks to provide users with musical inspiration and an opportunity to experience new songs. 

Here is a link to the landing page https://greytiger23.github.io. 

Features

Feature 1: An animated blob loader that adds a playful and artistic touch as you wait for the program to launch.

Feature 2: A music suggestion engine that pulls up tracks you've enjoyed.

Feature 3: The ability for users to store their music in playlists.

Inspiration

This project was inspired by my love of music and my daily exposure to new genres. When I'm working or relaxing, I always need some music to keep me going. Music is peaceful and lovely, so when I discover new music or songs I've never heard before, I get excited because I can enter that artist's world while listening to the beats and words. I have always been and will continue to be a music lover, so I created this project for others who share my passion.
