Greetings from Light! The goal of this project is to give the user recommendations for music based on the music they already enjoy. It seeks to provide users with musical inspiration and an opportunity to experience new songs. 

Here is a link to the landing page https://greytiger23.github.io. 

Features

Feature 1: An animated blob loader that adds a playful and artistic touch as you wait for the program to launch.

Feature 2: A music suggestion engine that pulls up tracks you've enjoyed.

Feature 3: The ability for users to store their music in playlists.

Inspiration

This project was inspired by my love of music and my daily exposure to new genres. When I'm working or relaxing, I always need some music to keep me going. Music is peaceful and lovely, so when I discover new music or songs I've never heard before, I get excited because I can enter that artist's world while listening to the beats and words. I have always been and will continue to be a music lover, so I created this project for others who share my passion.

Story

I enjoy listening to music to calm down, relax or even hype myself up. My love for music started when I was young and I used to listen to Lebo Mathosa on TV, and watch music videos. It also came from watching movies and hearing the soundtracks that amplify a scene in a movie, it is really beautiful. I like changing genres every week to find new music, listening to different genres of music brings me joy especially when I find a new song that just makes me move. I made this website or app to achieve my goal of helping people find new music that peeks their interest. My website is a demo, because of license and copyright laws. It is an idea, my first project which I put together with the help from people and peers. It is an idea that I hope to actually make or rather deploy with actual music from artists.

Future Improvements

• Implement a music recommendations generator for different user preferences.

• Enhance user profile features to include more personalized data and insights.
